# Policy source file directories
# This list contains directories to be searched for policy files specified in
# POLICY_FILES below. This is the rough equivalent of the BOARD_SEPOLICY_DIRS
# variable in the BoardConfig.mk makefile, except it also specifies the AOSP
# sepolicy directory.
# This list can contain both strings and tuples (string, bool), where a bool
# value of True means that the directory must be searched recursively. E.g.:
# POLICY_DIRS = ["external/sepolicy",
#                ("device/intel/sepolicy", True)]
# Directories will be processed in the order in which they are specified.

# Policy source files
# This list contains file names to be searched in the POLICY_DIRS specified
# above. This is the rough equivalent of the sepolicy_build_files variable in
# the sepolicy Android.mk makefile.
# This list contains strings. It supports UNIX shell-style patterns ("*", ...)
# Files will be processed in the order in which they are specified.
