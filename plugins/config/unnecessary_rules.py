"""Configuration file for the unnecessary_rules plugin."""

# Do not make suggestions on rules coming from files in these paths
#
# e.g. to ignore AOSP:
# RULE_IGNORE_PATHS = ["external/sepolicy"]
RULE_IGNORE_PATHS = ["external/sepolicy",
                     "device/qcom/sepolicy",
                     "build/target/board/generic/sepolicy"]

# Only make suggestions for the following rule types
# SUPPORTED_RULE_TYPES = ("allow", "type_transition", "neverallow")
# This must be a tuple: if there is only one element, insert a trailing comma
SUPPORTED_RULE_TYPES = ("allow", "type_transition")

# Functionality 1
# Tuples of rules that must always be found together. If the first rule in the
# tuple is found in the policy, report any other rule in the tuple which is
# not in the policy.
#
# The plugin supports searching with placeholder arguments, e.g. you can
# specify such a tuple:
# ("type_transition @@ARG0@@ @@ARG1@@:process @@ARG2@@;",
#  "allow @@ARG0@@ @@ARG1@@:file execute;",
#  "allow @@ARG2@@ @@ARG1@@:file entrypoint;",
#  "allow @@ARG0@@ @@ARG2@@:process transition;")
# which will match the following set of rules:
#
#   type_transition initrc_t acct_exec_t:process acct_t;
#   allow initrc_t acct_exec_t:file execute;
#   allow acct_t acct_exec_t:file entrypoint;
#   allow initrc_t acct_t:process transition;
#
# N.B. the first rule in the tuple MUST contain all the placeholder arguments
#      used in later rules.

# List of debug types, which must not be in the user policy
# The plugin will report any rule which contains any of these types.
DEBUG_TYPES = [""]

# Functionality 3
# Dictionary of class-specific permissions required for a rule to make sense
# The plugin will report any rule which grants any permission from the first
# set without granting at least the required perms in the second set, or an
# additional set of permissions on another class.
# The dictionary key is the name of the class as a string; the dictionary value
# is a tuple of two sets of strings and a dictionary containing a set.
# E.g.:
# REQUIRED_PERMS = {"file": (set(["write", " read", "append", "ioctl"]), # SET1
#                            set(["open"]),                              # SET2
#                            {"fd": set(["use"])})                       # ADD
#                   }
# means: for class "file"
# IF any permission from SET1 is granted AND NOT (
#   (all the permissions in SET2 are granted)
#   OR
#   (for each class in the ADD dictionary, all permissions in the relative
#       set are granted)
#   ):
#     REPORT RULE
REQUIRED_PERMS = {"file": (set(["write", "read", "append", "ioctl"]),
                           set(["open"]),
                           {"fd": set(["use"])})
                  }

# Do not report these rules
# Rules in this configuration parameter will be ignored when looking for the
# first rule in a tuple (functionality 1), when looking for rules containing
# debug types (functionality 2) and when looking for rules not granting desired
# permissions (functionality 3).
# They WILL be detected, if applicable, when looking for matching additional
# rules in tuples (functionality 1).
# The rules must match exactly as strings
# e.g.
# IGNORED_RULES = ["allow domain type:class permission;"]
